# Entry 6
##### 6/1/22

As I am wrapping my Freedom Project, looking back at the process it took me to achieve my product, feels amazing. Finalizing my code and my website was stressful. Having an MVP ready to present to my classmates was really helpful because I was able to use their feedback to help improve the original product I created. Practicing for the expo was really stressful too. We created an elevator pitch, an introduction that introduces the product in less than a minute, to welcome the judges and inform them about our individual projects. It was a stressful day because we had created this project all year long and now we are getting ready to present it to the judges. I remember committing to firebase to create a todo-list and now everything is over and the presentations are over. 

### Engineering Design Process: 

Currently where I'm at with the `Engineering Design Process` is `communicating the results`. After finishing the expo, I created a presentation on Google Slides to present my product to my classmates. I was able to use previous blog entries to reflect on my learning process. The presentation was also nerve-racking because I was nervous about the fact of standing in front of the room and presenting to the whole class. I was able to learn from this presentation skills that will help me later on in life. 


### Skills: 

I have learned a lot of `skills` throughout the process of me creating my project but also presenting my project. One skill I learned is the ability to present confidently while maintaining eye contact throughout the crowd. I also learned a really important factor for presentations. This factor is having a hook to grab the listener's attention so that they are interested in hearing what you will say.
