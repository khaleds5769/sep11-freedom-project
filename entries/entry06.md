# Entry 6
##### 6/1/22

As I am wrapping my Freedom Project, looking back at the process it took me to achieve my product, it feels amazing. Finalizing my code and my website was stressful. Having an mvp ready to present to my classmates was really helpful because I was able to use their feedback to help improve on the original product I created. Practicing for the expo was really stressful too. We created an elevator pitch, an introduction that introduces the product in less than a minute, to welcome the judges and inform them about our indiviudal projects. It was a stressful day because we had created this project all year long and now we are getting ready to present to the judges. I remember commiting to firebase to create a todo-list and now everything is over and the presentations are over. 


Currently where I'm at with the `Engineering Design Process` is `communitcating the results`. After finishing the expo, I created a presentation on google slide to present my product to my classmates. I was able to use previous blog entries to reflect on my learning process. Presentation was also nerve-racking because I was nervous with the fact of standing in front of the room presenting to the whole class. I was able to learn from this presentation skills that will help me later on in life.
