### My Tool

For this Freedom Project, I will be using `Firebase` to create a `To-do List`. I want to use Firebase because I see the importance of it in any thing you will create. Firebase allows me to store and save users data. I want to be able to do this because my project is to create a to-do list and it will require data to be stored in order for everything to be saved when logged out. Firebase is a hard and complex tool to learn which is also what made me want to be able to learn and build a website with firebase. The idea of storing user's data without being deleted or lost grabs my attention. Throughout the process of learning Firebase, I will be using `firebase.google.com` and research on the internet while also looking through the firebase slack channel. 


### My interactive program: 


The interactive program that I will be creating is a To-do list. I want to do a to-do list because I feel like it's one of those things that may seem "useless" until it's actually used. A to-do list not only helps you remember what you need to do but it also helps organize everything and releases stress out of your mind. I personally struggle sometimes struggle wtih organizing what I need to do so creating this to-do list will not only help the users but also me. 


### Where I am at: 


Currently in the `Engineering Design Process`, I am researching and learning my tool which is firebase. The next step in the Engineering Design Process that I will need to achieve is to start building with my tool.
