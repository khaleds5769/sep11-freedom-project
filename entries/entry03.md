## My goal: 

As I continue to search the web, I learned new information about firebase. I wanted to learn the different functions firebase could bring. I also wanted to start writing code into my terminal and discover the different errors I could receive. 

## What I found: 

I found the information I need to know. Backtrack, I realized that after downloading firebase onto my ide for the first time, I downloaded things I didn't need.I also didn't really know what got downloaded into my ide. 

Here is what I imported: 

```js
import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';
import { getAuth } from 'firebase/auth';
import { getFirestore } from 'firebase/firestore';

const firebaseApp = initializeapp({
// here goes in the info about the project on [firebase.google.com].
})

```
## What I need to know

I needed to know how to start saving data from the user. I found that in order to take the user's input and save it you will need to use `public String`. 

Here is how it would look: 

```js
public static class User {

  public String date_of_birth;
  public String full_name;
  public String nickname;

  public User(String dateOfBirth, String fullName) {
    // ...
  }
  
 ```
 
Engineering Design Process: 

Currently where I am in the Engineering Design Process is that I am testing and researching the different functions/names for firebase. Firebase has the same functions as the other languages, however, it may have a different name. 

Skills: 

The skills I have gained through my learning process is openly aware of the different things I am observing on the internet. A thing I am starting to keep an eye out for is dates on videos and websites. Outdated websites and videos may not be helpful as a video made in 2021 or this year. Another skill I gained is time management. I am controlling how long I search and how long I should experiment.
