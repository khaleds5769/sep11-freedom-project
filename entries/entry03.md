## My goal: 

As I continue to search the web, I learned new information about firebase. I wanted to learn the different functions firebase could bring. I also wanted to start writing code into my terminal and discover the different errors I could receive. 

## What I found: 

I found the information I need to know. Backtrack, I realized that after downloading firebase onto my ide for the first time, I downloaded things I didn't need.I also didn't really know what got downloaded into my ide. 

Here is what I imported: 

```js
import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';
import { getAuth } from 'firebase/auth';
import { getFirestore } from 'firebase/firestore';

const firebaseApp = initializeapp({
// here goes in the info about the project on firebase.google.com.
})

```
## What I need to know

I need to know how to make a function with firebase as well grabbing important lines of code from the firestore. 

Here is how it would look: 

```js
firebase.auth().register(username, password) {

}
  
 ```
 This line of code gets the data from [firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/get-data) and then it runs the function: 
 
 ```js 
 
 
 docRef.get().then(function(doc){ 
     
}

```
 
## Engineering Design Process: 

Currently where I am in the `Engineering Design Process` is that I am testing and researching the different code [functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/?authuser=0#how_does_it_work) and how to run functions locally for firebase. Firebase has the same functions as the other languages, however, it may have a different name. 


## Skills: 

The `skills` I have gained through my learning process is openly aware of the different things I am observing on the internet. A thing I am starting to keep an eye out for is dates on videos and websites. Outdated websites and videos may not be helpful as a video made in 2021 or this year. Another skill I gained is time management. I am controlling how long I search and how long I should experiment.
